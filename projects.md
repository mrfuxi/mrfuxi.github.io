# My side projects

As most developers, I also have my side projects I'm working on after hours.
Every of those side projects it's like an itch I had to scratch...

### Test runner for TDD

There are times you want to rerun your tests as you're writing your code or test for that code.

As I really want to focus on code and not switching to different console to fire off tests and wait for result I've created a python module that does it for me and reports any problems.

Current state: Most of functionality I would like to have in place

Repo: <https://github.com/mrfuxi/testrunner>

### Image search

Idea is simple: be able to search for an image based on different image or a sketch.

But it's harder to execute. It has to be fast, scale and rotation invariant.

Current state: Still working on it... :)

Repo: ToDo

### Sphinx plug-in for Sublime

I would like to use Sphinx documentation more in my work. So why not have a little help from Sublime

Current state: Planned

### Data anomaly analyser

When working on analysis engine I could not create automatic finder of *gaps* in data (due to lack of time and prioritization). However it's the one those of thinks I have to do, and I will on my own :)

Base idea of that is to find gaps in data (market) comparing different data sets (market coverages)

Current state: Planned. Have some ideas in my head how to do that

### QT Enginio (open source)

Open source *Backend as a service* for QT. Why creating it, because I thing others will benefit (not to mention I will have fun)

Current state: Planned.

### Media centre

I know there are number of media centres (like XBMC), but I would like to create a suite of tools that will play together:
* Server (running on RaspberryPi). That can use NAS or other source of data
* Mobile application (for telephone and tablet)
* Web app to use it on PC

I might end up wring XBMC plug-in for backend but mobile and web part has to be done any way

Current state: Planned.
