# This site

It's a place for me to share some thoughts and experiences about different aspects of software development inspired by a day to day work and coding after hours.

Most of the content will be around **Python**, **Solr** and **Docker** three areas I'm focusing right now. I'm sure it will evolve as my focus will shift this or the other direction.

# Me

My name is Karol, and as you've might guessed, I'm **professional software developer**. And I love it!

Since 2010 I'm living and working in London.

I'm coding professionally since 2008.

My area of expertise includes:

- Python
- Solr (creating and customizing search engines)
- C++
- Linux and Unix
